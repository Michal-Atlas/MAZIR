# Code style

* Really unreadable variable names
* Dead code `COMPARE_ON_ERROR`
* Use true/false instead of 1/0
* Crazy long lines
* Use continue statement to avoid unnecessary indentation
* Poor doc/comments 
	* Explain arg parsing behaviour
	* Explain what that crazy long line does

Overall quite unreadable solution

# Functionality

* Report is confusing to me 
* I'd expect option tu supress all output -- imagine program produces 10000 lines of output and you try to find which tests failed

Required functionality -- OK
